## üì¶ Microservices Overview

| Service          | Port   | Description                                                           |
| ---------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API Gateway      | `3000` | Centralized entry point for all services and Swagger docs             |
| Auth Service     | `3001` | Handles user login and JWT generation                                 |
| Employee Service | `3002` | Manages employee CRUD                                                 |

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-root>
```

## 2. Create MySQL Databases

```sql
CREATE DATABASE tm-auth;
CREATE DATABASE tm-employee;
CREATE DATABASE tm-task;
```

## 3. ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Each Service

Each service uses Sequelize. Update the config/config.json file with your DB credentials.

### Example config/config.json:

```json
{
  "development": {
    "username": "your username",
    "password": "your password",
    "database": "tm-employee",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  }
}
```
### Replace "tm-employee" with:

 * tm-auth in auth-service
 * tm-employee in employee-service
 * tm-task in task-service


## 4. üë§ Seed an Admin User (Auth Service)
To create a default admin user (admin / admin0000), run the seed script in the Auth Service:

```bash
cd auth-service
node seeders/user.seeder.js
```

This will create an initial admin user if one does not already exist.

You should see Admin user created. or Admin user already exists. in your terminal.

## 5. üöÄ Start Each Service

### Auth Service (3001)
```bash
cd auth-service
npm install
npm start
```

### Employee Service (3002)
```bash
cd employee-service
npm install
npm start
```

### Task Service (3003)
```bash
cd task-service
npm install
npm start
```

### üåê API Gateway (3000)
```bash
cd api-gateway
npm install
node index.js
```

## Access Swagger docs at:
```bash
http://localhost:3000/docs
```

## ‚úÖ Done!

You can now:
* Authenticate via /login
* Manage employees via /employees
* Manage tasks via /tasks

All routes are accessible through the API Gateway.
